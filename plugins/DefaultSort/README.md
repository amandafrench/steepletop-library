DefaultSort
===========

This plugin can be used to change the Omeka default sorting, which is set to `date added`. Any metadata element may be used as the new default sort when browsing either collections or items.

#### Please note

It would probably be a good idea, to add whichever sort field you select in the plugin, to the list of sort links in your browse views. Take a look at the Omeka default theme for an example of how this can be done:

`/Omekaroot/themes/default/items/browse`

###### Thanks

Thanks to @patrickmj from the Omeka Dev Team, for the basic filter implementation.
